1. Quantum Inspired Everett's Healey Neural Network - Classification Accuracy with Post Processing - 88 to 90 Percent with Post Processing
   (still does not cross the linear threshold , but with more advanced classical post processing to especially classify the unique test which are the        most misclassified is needed.)

2. Lagrangian Plus Chebyshev NN
3. Multivariate Taylor/Chebyshev Basis NN
4. Recurrent Polynomial NN(Direct Training)
5. Chebyshev NN (Direct Training)

PS - All the five types discussed in the paper will be uploaded later-
