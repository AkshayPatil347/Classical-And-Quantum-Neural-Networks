1. Quantum Inspired Everett's Healey Neural Network - Classification Accuracy with Post Processing - 88 to 90 Percent with Post Processing
   (still does not cross the linear threshold , but with more advanced classical post processing to especially classify the unique test which are the        most misclassified is needed.)

PS - All the six types discussed in the paper will be uploaded later-
