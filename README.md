1. Quantum Inspired Everett's Healey Neural Network - Classification Accuracy with Post Processing - 88 to 90 Percent with Post Processing
   (still does not cross the linear threshold , but with more advanced classical post processing to especially classify the unique test which are the        most misclassified is needed.)
   Note - The probaibli5 amplitude criteria of threshold 0.707 for bit mesurement is strict step function but in quantum computers either bit can still occur , so on actual quantum computer multple measurements per input vector will be needed to trace all the paths and then get the output counts of measurement and see which is greater , and as per that the input is classified by comparing with targets and other criterias discussed in the code.

3. Lagrangian Plus Chebyshev NN
4. Multivariate Taylor/Chebyshev Basis NN
5. Recurrent Polynomial NN(Direct Training)
6. Chebyshev NN (Direct Training)

PS - All the five types discussed in the paper will be uploaded later-
